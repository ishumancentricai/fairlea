Law enforcement agencies are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to
increase the efficiency of investigations. At the same time, however, these new technologies
pose risks to the freedom of society and individual affected persons, such as being
innocently prosecuted or discriminated against. These risks are mainly due to the use of non-
transparent black box AI tools that are hard to comprehend and explain to those involved in
criminal proceedings as well as machine-learned biases.
Cryptoassets, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are widely used to commit crimes, especially but
not limited to trafficking in illegal goods and services, fraud, and extortion. The prosecution of
those crimes heavily relies on so-called cryptoasset tracing tools, which use heuristics and
statistical methods to follow the money and deanonymize users potentially involved in
criminal activities. Although the use of classic (non-AI-supported) methods for law
enforcement in cryptoasset systems is now well-researched, there has been a lack of
research on the use of AI for law enforcement in cryptoasset systems from a legal and
technical perspective.
Therefore, this research group aims to investigate, through a case study of cryptoasset
forensics, how AI-supported tools can be utilized in criminal investigations to meet both the
demands of law enforcement authorities and all legal obligations under German and
European law.
